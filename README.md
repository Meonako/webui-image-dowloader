# AUTOMATIC1111's Web UI Image Downloader

Alright, I recently enter the world of Image Generation AI and have been using [AUTOMATIC1111's Web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) BUT I can't run this locally all the time so I try out Google Colab. 

And a problem arose "**I CANT DOWNLOAD LARGE FILE**" so here it is.

### ***NOTE*** : I don't know if I'll update it or not. So, for the far future people, this might **NOT** work!

# Install

I have ***NOT*** package or deploy yet and I don't have plan to. So the only way is to clone this repo and load unpacked

### If you're not sure how it's done. You should google it, because there are a lot of tutorial already.

# Usage

after loaded unpacked, pin the extension to the address bar
> On Google Chrome
